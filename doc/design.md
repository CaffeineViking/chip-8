Design
======

This document is here to get a rough idea on how things are going to be implemented. Memory, processor, pipeline, display, keyboard, sound and timer are the modules I think are needed. These might not be separeted files by themselves, but these modules are more here to divide functionallity I think needs to be digested in chunks. Memory is problem, processor another (not related) etc... Emulator/interpreter will be written in C/C++ using very little stdlib functionality, most dependencies will lie on SDL2.
